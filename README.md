Owl Rest Edition Skeleton
=========================

Special edition for easy creation of REST API services.

Web Server Setup
----------------

### PHP CLI Server

The simplest way to get started if you are using PHP 5.4 or above is to start the internal PHP cli-server in the root directory:

```sh
php -S 0.0.0.0:8080 -t public/ public/index.php
```

This will start the cli-server on port 8080, and bind it to all network interfaces.

**Note: ** The built-in CLI server is *for development only*.
